# YoutubeBackingTracks
A Windows 10 WPF program in c# using Microsoft.Web.WebView2.1.0.705.50, that I started to collect and save YouTube music backing-track videos.
The videos are played in a web-view as embedded video, so no commercials and other YouTube stuff
I made it as simple as possible and added comments, so anyone can change it and use it for his or her own collections.
The Video links are saved in a XML-file.
It can also be used to add any youtube video and watch it as enbedded video. 
It is far from perfect, but it is just an example.
